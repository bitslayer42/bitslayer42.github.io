50

Fifty truly is a grand old age,
each day we greet, the turning of a page.
The book enscribed but chapters fade to grey,
the future we can't know until that day.

Amanda stands before me as a dream,
Now seven squared plus one for luck it seems.
How can this be? The years so fleet. And yet...
she looks exactly like the day we met.

That day, in Mitchell County long ago,
with crazy Z. and ever steady Mo.
Our weekends spent in mild debauchery,
filled with sounds of breaking pottery.

Our wedding day with love and lots to eat,
they used your parasols against the heat.
The spiral dance, a joyous happy day.
The photos came out good, or so they say.

Nurses/Chaplains/Aides will come and go,
Amanda sticks around because she knows,
the sturdiness of thirty cement trucks,
The fortitude to handle Linda Fluck.

Each day's commute reveals another pain,
but I think of you to pacify my brain.
Your car returns you from the Pleides,
from table tennis, speaking Japanese.

Some day I dream we'll find us undefeated,
our juggling routine properly completed,
Still juggling work, commitments, memory gaps,
life and health and lots of cozy naps.
