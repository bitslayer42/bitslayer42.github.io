Fifty truly is a grand old age,<br>
each day we greet, the turning of a page.<br>
The book enscribed but chapters fade to grey,<br>
the future we can't know until that day.<br>
</p><p>
Amanda stands before me as a dream,<br>
Now seven squared plus one for luck it seems.<br>
How can this be? The years so fleet. And yet...<br>
she looks exactly like the day we met.<br>
</p><p>
That day, in Mitchell County long ago,<br>
with crazy Z. and ever steady Mo.<br>
Our weekends spent in mild debauchery,<br>
filled with sounds of breaking pottery.<br>
</p><p>
Our wedding day with love and lots to eat,<br>
they used your parasols against the heat.<br>
The spiral dance, a joyous happy day.<br>
The photos came out good, or so they say.<br>
</p><p>
Nurses/Chaplains/Aides will come and go,<br>
Amanda sticks around because she knows,<br>
the sturdiness of thirty cement trucks,<br>
The fortitude to handle Linda Fluck.<br>
</p><p>
Each day's commute reveals another pain,<br>
but I think of you to pacify my brain.<br>
Your car returns you from the Pleides,<br>
from table tennis, speaking Japanese.<br>
</p><p>
Some day I dream we'll find us undefeated,<br>
our juggling routine properly completed,<br>
Still juggling work, commitments, memory gaps,<br>
life and health and lots of cozy naps.<br>
